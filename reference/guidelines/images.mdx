# Image Sizing

Content displayed on the site is managed through Slices. Each slice document
explains image size guidelines.

It's recommended to utilize the Image Resizer application to compress and resize
your images before uploading them to Prismic. Each slice guide will specify
which preset to select in the Image Resizer app.

For details on installing the Image Resizer app, please refer to the _Image
Resizer_ section.
