# Overview

Slices are configurable blocks of content with a predefined look and feel. All
pages are made using these building blocks to ensure each page stays within with
the overall design of the site.

Content editors do not need to know website coding to create well-designed
pages. Instead, Slices contain a preset collection of fields that allow the page
author to customize the content and media displayed.

A Page can contain any number of Slices in any order. General recommendations
are explained in each Slice's reference document.

# Example of Slices in a Page

A hypothetical product page could be made with the following slices:

1. **Hero Image** - Quick visual introduction to the product.
2. **Text** - Text content describing the product.
3. **Images** - Collection of product images.
4. **Text** - Additional product information.
5. **Call to Action** - Link to sign up for the product or to get more
   information.

Additional slices could be inserted anywhere within that list. The surrounding
slices will move around as necessary.
