# Plan Details

Prismic bases its pricing on number of users. As of April 2019, %SITE_TITLE is
on Prismic's **Starter** plan which allows three users to access the CMS.

Wall-to-Wall is one of those users, allowing two additional users to be added.

We recommend upgrading the plan or creating a generic login that can be used by
multiple people if the number of users is a concern.

| Plan Name    | # of users      |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| **Starter**  | 3 users         |
| **Small**    | 7 users         |
| **Medium**   | 25 users        |
| **Platinum** | Unlimited users |

# Access Levels

With the Starter and Small plan, all users are given the Administrator Role.
Administrators are the highest level of access and have the ability to manage
custom types, collections, users, OAuth authorizations, etc. As the highest
level, Administrators have access to all the technical aspects of the CMS and
its configuration so care has to be taken to not change certain settings or
lines of code.

# Adding, Editing, and Removing Users

The following article from Prismic describes how to add a user. Editing and
removing users is performed using the same interface as adding users.
