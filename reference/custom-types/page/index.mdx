# Use Case

Each Page in the CMS represents a page on the live site. Other custom types,
such as Navigation and Info Card, do not create pages on the site.

All pages within the website start with the main header and end with the main
footer. All content on a page is designed to be responsive to work on both
mobile and desktop devices.

Within the CMS, the Page custom type has two sections: **Main** and **Body**.

- **Body**: All public-facing content on a page
- **Main**: Metadata like page title and URL

<Callout heading="Reminder" type="info">

If the content type is not a **Page**, it is not a page on the website.

</Callout>

# Slices

Pages are built with pre-styled blocks of content called **Slices**. They allow
content editors to compose pages with unique content and organization while
keeping within the website's design guidelines.

For a list of all available slices, refer to the Slices page.

<LinkCard title="Slices" href="/reference/custom-types/page/slices">
  All the slices available to the Page custom type.
</LinkCard>

# Page Types

By default, a Page is a free area to provide content using Slices. This gives
complete flexibility in how to display and order content.

There are cases where having complete flexibility may not be the most effective
solution. For example, if we have many pages representing news posts and we want
to ensure all pages look the same, we would need to ensure the pages are built
using the same Slices in the same order. If we decide to update the look of
these pages, we need to update every news post page.

To reduce the need to edit every page, each page can be given a **Page Type**
instead. Page Types allow pages to contain a default set of Slices with unique
styling as necessary.

For a list of all available Page Types, refer to the Page Types page.

<LinkCard href="/reference/custom-types/page/page-types/" title="Page Types">
  List of page types.
</LinkCard>

## Recommendations

### UID

The UID \(unique identifier\) is used to create the page's URL. A page with a
UID of "about-us" will create a page at `https://www.%SITE_URL.org/about-us/`.

UIDs must be unique among all pages. For example, there cannot be two pages with
the same UID of `about-us`.

The UID is automatically generated from the Title by converting it to lowercase,
removing punctuation, and replacing spaces with dashes. For example, "About Us"
becomes `about-us`. This can be changed manually, but be sure to keep it concise
and meaningful.

### Parent

The parent field determines a parent-child relationship between pages. Content
can be grouped together under a parent page by connecting multiple pages to the
same parent.

A page's URL is built using a combination of the page's UID, the parent's UID,
and the parent's parent's UID, if any. For example, if the About Us page is the
parent of the History page, the History page's URL could be `/about-us/history`.
If the Company page is the parent of About Us, the History page's URL could be
`/company/about-us/history`.

We recommend keeping the URL to three levels or less to keep the URL readable.

### Meta Title

The Meta Title field overrides Title in all places except within Prismic. For
example, a page with Title as "Careers" and Meta Title as "Careers in Honolulu,
Hawaii" will show "Careers" on Prismic and "Careers in Honolulu, Hawaii" on
Google.

Using SEO \(search engine optimization\) wording tricks can boost a site's
search engine ranking. Use of this field should be done deliberately with a
specific purpose.

### Meta Description

The Meta Description field provides search engines with a description of the
page to display on search results. Note that search results will not always
display the description; if the search engine determines a snippet of page text
is more relevant than the description, the snippet will be displayed instead. s
more relevant than the description, the snippet will be displayed instead.
