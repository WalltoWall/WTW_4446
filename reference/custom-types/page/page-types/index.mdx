# What are Page Types?

By default, a Page is a free area to provide content using Slices. This gives
complete flexibility in how to display and order content.

There are cases where having complete flexibility may not be the most effective
solution. For example, if we have many pages representing news posts and we want
to ensure all pages look the same, we would need to ensure the pages are built
using the same Slices in the same order. If we decide to update the look of
these pages, we need to update every news post page.

To reduce the need to edit every page, each page can be given a **Page Type**
instead. Page Types allow pages to contain a default set of Slices with unique
styling as necessary.
