# Use Case

The list of links used in the site's header and footer is managed through
Navigation documents.

<Callout type="info" heading="Heads Up!">

There are two documents that are already defined named "Primary" and
"Secondary". These documents control the links that are displayed within the
site's header and footer.

**Do not delete these documents.**

</Callout>

# Slices

Navigation items are grouped using **Nav Item** slices. For example, to have a
top-level "About Us" page with "Careers" as a child:

1. Create a Nav Item slice.
2. Set "About Us" as the name.
3. Add "Careers" as an item in the repeatable zone.

**Nav Item** is the only slice available for Navigation documents. The following
fields refer to **Nav Item**.

# Fields

<FieldsTable>
  <Field
    name="Name"
    type="Text"
    description="Text to display for the link."
    required={true}
  />
  <Field
    name="Link"
    type="Link"
    description="Link to navigate to when clicking on the link. Can be internal or external."
    required={true}
  />
</FieldsTable>

# Repeatable Fields

Each item in the repeatable zone represents a child link. The order of the items
determines the order of the links.

<FieldsTable>
  <Field
    name="Name"
    type="Text"
    description="Text to display for the link."
    required={true}
  />
  <Field
    name="Link"
    type="Link"
    description="Link to navigate to when clicking on the link. Can be internal or external."
    required={true}
  />
</FieldsTable>
