# Overview

The %SITE_TITLE website uses multiple services to function:

- **CMS**: The website's content management system (CMS) is provided by
  [Prismic](https://prismic.io). The CMS is used to create, edit, and publish
  content on the site.

- **Hosting**: The public-facing website is hosted on
  [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The host stores and serves the website to
  visitors using HTTPS encryption.

Content editors will typically only interact with Prismic.
