# Client Reference

Clients are provided detailed documentation for all web projects. The following
sections describe why and what to include.

## What to provide clients

In addition to a fully working website, clients should be provided documentation
explaining how to maintain and update the site. This involves explaining the
fundamental elements such as Slices and CMS custom types.

The better we can describe how the site should be maintained and updated, the
better the site will function and look down the road.

Documentation should cover the following:

- How to use Prismic
- How to build and update pages with Slices
- What Slices are available
- What content types are available and how they interact with eachother

## A living reference

The reference documentation lives within the project's codebase. This makes
updating and reading the documentation easy for developers. By reducing the
friction of updating the documentation, we can better ensure it stays up to date
when new features or fixes are implemented.

Be sure to add the proper documentation when making structural changes to the
site such as adding new slices. This will make it easier for not only clients to
understand the site, but also other developers and Wall-to-Wall employees.
